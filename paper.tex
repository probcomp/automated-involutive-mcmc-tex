\begin{abstract}
Involutive MCMC is a unifying framework for MCMC that encompasses many standard
and recent MCMC algorithms from the literature, from reversible jump MCMC to
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to kernels based on deep neural networks. The key idea
in involutive MCMC is that a combination of (i) an auxiliary probability
distribution and (ii) an involution on the extended state space that includes
the model latent variables and the auxiliary variables results in MCMC kernels
that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target distribution. The
involutive MCMC framework is appealing for its simplicity and generality, and
promises to be a useful conceptual and mathematical tool for exploring the
design space of MCMC kernels. However, like other Monte Carlo samplers,
implementing involutive samplers is time consuming and error prone. This paper
describes a technique for automatically generating the implementation of
involutive MCMC samplers from two probabilistic programs that define the target
distribution and the auxiliary probability distribution respectively, and a
differentiable program that defines the involution. The technique also detects
common conceptual and programming errors that arise when designing and
specifying involutive MCMC algorithms. This paper describes the support for
involutive MCMC in the Gen probabilistic system that uses this technique, and
shows involutive samplers specified using Gen's high-level probabilistic and
differentiable programming languages.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:involution-detailed-balance} % TODO cite
For $p$, $q$, and $f$ satisfying the properties above, let $k'$ denote the following transition kernel on $Z$:
\[
k'_z(A) := [f(z) \in A] \alpha(z) + [z \in A](1 - \alpha(z))
\]
The transition kernel $k'$ on $Z$ defined by the involution $f$ satisfies detailed balance with respect to $\pi$:
\[
\int_B k'_z(A) \pi(dz) = \int_A k'_z(B) \pi(dz) \mbox{ for all } A, B \in \Sigma_Z
\]
And in particular it is stationary with respect to $\pi$:
\[
\int_Z k'_z(A) \pi(dz) = \pi(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_Z
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:stationarity}
The transition kernel $k$ on $X$ defined by Algorithm~\ref{alg:involutive-mcmc} for valid $p$, $q$, and $f$:
\[
k_x(A) := \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \;\; \mbox{for all} \;\; A \in \Sigma_X, x \in X
\]
is stationary with respect to $p$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\citep{lemma:involution-detailed-balance}, the transition kernel $k'$ is stationary with respect to $\pi$:
\[
%\int_B k'_{z}(B) \pi(z) \mu(dz) = \pi(B) \mbox{ for all } z \in X \times U, B \in \Sigma_Z
\]
It suffices to show that
\begin{align*}
\int_X k_x(A) p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_X\\
\int_X \left( \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \right) p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A)\\
\int_{X \times U} k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) p(x) \mu(dz) &= p(A)
\end{align*}
By Lemma~\citep{lemma:involution-detailed-balance}, setting $B := X \times U$, the left-hand-side is:
\[
\pi(X \times U) = \int_X \int_U p(x) q_x(u) \mu(

\subsection{Distributions on traces}
% TODO rewrite this section..
Define target density $\pi$ (XXX below it is called $p$, fix this) on the joint space $X \times U$, where $X$ are traces of the model and $X$ are traces of the proposal, in terms of the density $p(x)$ and the family of densities $q_x(u)$ as $\pi(x, u) := p(x) q_u(x)$.

% TODO rename the joint target density to \pi below
We want to show stationarity with respect to $\pi$, using stationarity of the involution with respect to the joint density (below).
\begin{equation}
\int_X p(x) \ell_x(A) \mu(dx) = p(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma
\end{equation}
where $\ell_x(A)$ is the probability of transitioning into set $A$ from $x$, and is given by:
\begin{equation}
\ell_x(A) := \int_U k_{(x, u)}(A \times U) \mu(du)
\end{equation}
where $k_{(x, u)}$ is the measure on $X \times U$ that is induced by applying the involution $h$ to the state $(x, u)$.

\subsection{Derivation of the pushforward Radon-Nikodym derivative for a special case}
We consider the special case in which the involution $f$ can be factored into an involution on a countable set $I$ and a family of bijections on $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ for some $n_i$ for each $i \in I$.
Suppose $Z = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : i \in I, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}\}$.
Suppose $f_1$ is an involution on $I$ and $n_i = n_{f_1(i)}$ and $f_2$ is a family of continuously differentiable bijections indexed by $i \in I$, such that $f_{2,i} : \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$.
Also suppose that $f_{2,i} = f_{2,f_1(i)}^{-1}$ for all $i \in I$. That is,
\begin{equation}
f_{2,i}(f_{2,f_1(i)}(\mathbf{x})) = \mathbf{x} \mbox{ for all } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \mbox{ and all } i \in I
\end{equation} 
Then, $f : Z \to Z : (i, \mathbf{x}) \mapsto (f_1(i), f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x}))$ is an involution because:
\begin{equation}
f(f(i, \mathbf{x})) = f(f_1(i), f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x})) = (f_1(f_1(i)), f_{2,f_1(i)}(f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x}))) = (i, \mathbf{x})
\end{equation}
Let $\Sigma_n$ and $\mu_n$ denote the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra and Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively.
Let $\Sigma \subset \mathcal{P}(Z)$ be the $\sigma$-algebra of sets of the form $\cup_{i \in I} \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i\}$ for some $A_i \in \Sigma_{n_i}$ for each $i \in I$.
%Let $\Sigma$ be the $\sigma$-algebra on $Z$ generated by the sets $G := \{ \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} : i \in I, A \in \Sigma_{n_i} \}$.
%Note that the sets $G$ form a $\pi$-system:
%\begin{align}
%\{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} \cap \{(j, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in B\} = \varnothing = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in \varnothing \} \in G \mbox{ for } i \ne j\\
%\{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} \cap \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in B\} = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A \cap B\} \in G \mbox{ because } A \cap B \in \Sigma_{n_i}
%\end{align}
Let $\mu$ denote the measure on measurable space $(Z, \Sigma)$ given by:%, uniquely defined by its value on the sets $G$:
\begin{equation}
\mu(\cup_{i \in I} \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i\}) := \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(A_i)
\end{equation}
We wish to show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the pushforward of $\mu$ by $f$ with respect to $\mu$, evaluated at $(i, \mathbf{x})$, is the absolute value of the Jacobian (determinant) of the function $f_{2,i}$ evaluated at $\mathbf{x}$, which is denoted $(J f_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(i, \mathbf{x})
= \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right|
\end{equation}
Consider $(\mu \circ f^{-1})(A)$ for $A \in \Sigma$:
\begin{align}
(\mu \circ f^{-1})(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \})
&= \mu(f^{-1}(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \}))\\
&= \mu(\cup_{i \in I} f^{-1}(\{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \}))\\
&= \mu(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (f_1(i), \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in f_{2,i}(A_i) \})\\
&= \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i))
\end{align}
It suffices to show that for all $A \in \Sigma$:
\begin{equation}
\int_A \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu(dz) = \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i))
\end{equation}
Expanding the left-hand side:
\begin{align}
\int_A \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu(dz)
= \sum_{i \in I} \int_{A_i} \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu_{n_i}(d \mathbf{x}) % TODO how to justify this? it seems obvious
= \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i)) % Borgachev Theorem 4.7.1 
\end{align}
where the final step uses Borgachev Theorem 3.7.1 with $g := 1$, and $F := f_{2,i}$.

\subsection{Proof of detailed balance for involution}
\citet{tierney1998note} gives a class of MCMC kernels based on involutions that satisfy detailed balance.
Specifically, given an involution $T : Z \to Z$, they denote the pushforward of $\pi$ under $T$ by $\pi'$:
$\pi'(A) := \pi(T^{-1}(A))$.
They let $\nu(A) := \pi(A) + \pi'(A)$.
They let $h(z)$ denote `a density for $\pi$ with respect to $\nu$'.
Then, they set:
\[
\alpha(x \to T(x)) \frac{h(x)}{h(T(x))} = \alpha(T(x) \to x)
\]
Our definition of $\alpha$ satisfies:
\[
\frac{\alpha(z \to T(z))}{\alpha(T(z) \to z)} = \frac{\pi(T(z))}{\pi(z)} \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu} (z) \right)
\]
Therefore, to use Tierney's result, it suffices to show that (when $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are $\sigma$-finite and have densities with respect to the same reference measure $\mu$):
\[
\frac{h(T(z))}{h(z)}= \frac{\pi(T(z))}{\pi(z)} \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu} (z) \right)
\]
(note that $T$ is our $f$).
What is $h(z)$, the density of $\pi$ with respect to $\nu(A) := \pi(A) + \pi'(A)$?
Well, if $\pi$ and $\pi'$ have densities with respect to $\mu$, then so does $\nu$, and it is $\nu(z) = \pi(z) + \pi'(z)$, so the density of $\pi$ with respect to $\nu$ is:
\[
h(z) = \frac{\pi(z)}{\nu(z)} %= \frac{\pi(z)}{\pi(z) + \pi'(z)}
\]
and therefore:
\[
\frac{h(T(z))}{h(z)} = \frac{\pi(T(z))}{\pi(z)} \cdot \frac{\nu(z)}{\nu(T(z))}
\]
It suffices to show that:
\[
\frac{\nu(T(z))}{\nu(z)} = \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu} \right)^{-1}
\]
First, note that $\nu$ and $\nu \circ T^{-1}$ are the same measure:
\begin{align}
\nu(A) &= \pi(A) + \pi'(A) = \pi(A) + \pi(T^{-1}(A))\\
(\nu \circ T^{-1})(A) &= \pi(T^{-1}(A)) + \pi(T^{-1}(T^{-1}(A))) = \pi(T^{-1}(A)) + \pi(A)
\end{align}
Therefore,
\[
\frac{d (\nu \circ T^{-1})}{d \nu}(z) = 1 \mbox{ for all } z
\]
Expanding $d(\nu \circ T^{-1}) / d \nu$ using the chain rule:
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{d (\nu \circ T^{-1})}{d \nu}(z)\\
&=   \frac{d (\nu \circ T^{-1})}{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}(z) \cdot
    \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu}(z) \cdot
    \frac{d \mu}{d \nu}(z)\\
&= \nu(T(z))  \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu} \frac{1}{\nu(z)}
\end{align}
where in the second step we used that
\begin{equation}
\frac{d (\nu \circ T^{-1})}{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}(z) = \frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(T(z)) = \nu(T(z))
\end{equation}
To show this, we use the definition of the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\nu \circ T^{-1}) / d (\mu \circ T^{-1})$.
To show that $z \mapsto (d \nu / d \mu)(T(z))$ is this Radon-Nikodym derivative, it suffices to show that for all measurable $A$:
\begin{equation}
\int_A \left( \frac{d \nu}{d \mu} (T(z)) \right) ( \mu \circ T^{-1} )(dz) = (\nu \circ T^{-1})(A) := \nu(T^{-1}(A))
\end{equation}
Applying Theorem 3.6.1 in Bogachev with $Y := A$, $y := z$, $x := z'$, $X := T^{-1}(A)$, $f := T$, and $g(y) := (d\nu / d\mu)(T(y))$:
\begin{align}
\int_A \left( \frac{d \nu}{d \mu} (T(z)) \right) ( \mu \circ T^{-1} )(dz)
&= \int_Y g(y) ( \mu \circ f^{-1} )(dy)\\
&= \int_X g(f(x)) \mu(dx) \;\;\;\; [\mbox{Bogachev Theorem 3.6.1}]\\
&= \int_{T^{-1}(A)} (d\nu / d\mu)(T(T(z'))) \mu(dz')\\
&= \int_{T^{-1}(A)} (d\nu / d\mu)(z') \mu(dz')\\
&= \int_{T^{-1}(A)} \nu(dz')
= \nu(T^{-1}(A))
\end{align}
% NOTE Bogachev's theorem uses domains of integration which are the whole
% sample spaces for the two sigma algebras.  I think that the theorem should
% also apply to any measurable sets A and T(A) because one can construct a
% sigma algebra and measure that are restricted to to any nonempty measurable
% set.

\subsection{Proof of stationarity for involution}
Stationarity follows from detailed balance by setting $B := Z$ in the detailed balance equation, and using $k'_z(Z) = \alpha(z) + (1 - \alpha(z)) =1$, so the right-hand side simplifies to $\int_A \pi(dz) = \pi(A)$.

\subsection{Proof of stationarity for end-to-end kernel}
We are given that the involution is stationary with respect to (the measure induced by) $\pi(x, u) := p(x) q_x(u)$:
\[
\int_Z k'_z(A) \pi(z) \mu(dz) = \pi(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_Z
\]
It suffices to show that the end-to-end kernel $k$ is stationary with respect to (the measure induced by) $p(x)$:
\[
\int_X k_x(A) p(x) \mu_X(dx) = p(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_X
\]
The kernel $k$ on $X$ defined by Algorithm~\ref{alg:involutive-mcmc} for valid $p$, $q$, and $f$:
\[
k_x(A) := \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \;\; \mbox{for all} \;\; A \in \Sigma_X, x \in X
\]
is stationary with respect to $p$.
\begin{align*}
    \int_X k_x(A) p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_X\\
    \int_X \left( \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \right) p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A)\\
    \int_{X \times U} k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) p(x) \mu(dz) &= p(A)\\
    \int_{X \times U} k'_{x,u}(A \times U) \pi(z) \mu(dz) &= p(A)\\
    \pi(A \times U) &= p(A)\\
    \int_{A \times U} q_x(u) p(x) \mu(dz) &= p(A)\\
    \int_A \left( \int_U q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \right) p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A)\\
    \int_A p(x) \mu_X(dx) &= p(A)
\end{align*}
