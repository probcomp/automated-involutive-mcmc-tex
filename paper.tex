\begin{abstract}
Involutive MCMC is a unifying framework for MCMC that encompasses many standard
and recent MCMC algorithms from the literature, from reversible jump MCMC to
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to kernels based on deep neural networks. The key idea
in involutive MCMC is that a combination of (i) an auxiliary probability
distribution and (ii) an involution on the extended state space that includes
the model latent variables and the auxiliary variables results in MCMC kernels
that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target distribution. The
involutive MCMC framework is appealing for its simplicity and generality, and
promises to be a useful conceptual and mathematical tool for exploring the
design space of MCMC kernels. However, like other Monte Carlo samplers,
implementing involutive samplers is time consuming and error prone. This paper
describes a technique for automatically generating the implementation of
involutive MCMC samplers from two probabilistic programs that define the target
distribution and the auxiliary probability distribution respectively, and a
differentiable program that defines the involution. The technique also detects
common conceptual and programming errors that arise when designing and
specifying involutive MCMC algorithms. This paper describes the support for
involutive MCMC in the Gen probabilistic system that uses this technique, and
shows involutive samplers specified using Gen's high-level probabilistic and
differentiable programming languages.

\section{INVOLUTIVE MCMC} \label{sec:involutive-mcmc}
Let $(X, \Sigma_P, \mu_P)$ and $(Y, \Sigma_Q, \mu_Q)$ denote two measure spaces with $\sigma$-finite $\mu_P$ and $\mu_Q$.
Let $p : X \to [0, \infty)$ be a probability density with respect to $\mu_P$ and for each $x \in X$ such that $p(x) > 0$ let $q_x : Y \to [0, \infty)$ be probability density with respect to $\mu_Q$.
We call $p$ the \emph{model density} and we call $q_x$ \emph{auxiliary densities}.
Let $\pi(x, y) := p(x) q_x(y)$ and $Z := \{(x, y) \in X \times Y : \pi(x, y) > 0 \}$.
Suppose that $Z \in \Sigma_P \otimes \Sigma_Q$ ($Z$ is a $\mu_P \times \mu_Q$-measurable set).
Then $\Sigma := \{A \in \Sigma_P \otimes \Sigma_Q : A \subseteq Z\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $Z$ and $\mu : \Sigma \to [0, \infty)$ with $\mu(A) := (\mu_P \times \mu_Q)(A)$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure on measurable space $(Z, \Sigma)$.

Let $f : Z \to Z$ denote an involution ($f^{-1} = f$) such that the pushforward of $\mu$ under $f$, denoted $\mu \circ f^{-1}$, is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, with Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\mu \circ f^{-1}) / d\mu : Z \to [0, \infty)$.
Let $y \sim q_x(\cdot)$ denote a random sample from the measure defined by $A \mapsto \int_A q_x(y) \mu_Q(dy)$ for $A \in \Sigma_Q$.

See Section~\ref{sec:radon-nikodym-special-case} for a derivation of the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\mu \circ f^{-1}) / d \mu$ for a special case, when the involution $f$ can be factored into (i) an involution on a countable partition of $Z$ and (ii) a family of continuously differentiable bijection on Euclidean spaces.

\begin{theorem}[Involutive MCMC is stationary]
For $p$, $q$, and $f$ satisfying the requirements above, Algorithm~\ref{alg:involutive-mcmc} defines a probability kernel on $X$ that is stationary with respect to the distribution $p$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is presented in stages in the appendix (see Section~\ref{sec:involution-detailed-balance}, Section~\ref{sec:involution-is-stationary}, and Section~\ref{sec:involutive-mcmc-is-stationary}).
\end{proof}

\section{PROBABILISTIC PROGRAMMING WITH TRACES}

Probabilistic programs are programs that define probability distributions.
Probabilistic programs can be used to define standard joint probability distributions over vectors of random-variables, as well as more complex probability distributions with uncertainty over the structure in which the set of random variables itself random.
Involutive MCMC can be applied for target probability distributions on non-standard reference measures, including models with structure uncertainty.
For example, reversible jump MCMC, which is a special case of involutive MCMC, can be applied to switch between different model structures.
This section describes a framework for probabilistic programming that is expressive enough to represent probability distributions with structure uncertainty.

\subsection{Traces}
In our framework, a probabilistic program defines a probability distribution on finite dictionaries that map the name of a `random choice' to its value.
Following standard terminology in probabilistic programming~\citep{?}, we call these dictionaries \emph{traces} because they can be sampled by running a probabilistic program, and `tracing' the execution the program by recording the value of eacn random choice encountered.
In the probabilistic programming language used in this paper, the user assigns a unique name or \emph{address} to each random choice using a special syntax:

TODO: include example of tilde syntax

TODO: introduce the mathematical notation for a concrete trace (i.e. $\{a \mapsto 1, b \mapsto 2\}$).

\subsection{A probabilistic program encodes a probability distribution on traces}
For probabilistic programs that only sample individual random choices from discrete probability distributions, the meaning of the program can be described by a probability mass function that assigns a probailtiy to every possible trace.

TODO: Give a simple example of a probabilistic program with discrete random chocies and stochastic control flow, and the resulting probabiilty distribution.
TODO: describe the two variants of tilde syntax

Note that traces are always finite, but there can be no upper bound.
For example, for this program, there is a countably infinite number of possible traces:

TODO: show a discrete probabilistic prgram with the table of traces it could sample

% measure version
\subsection{Handling Continuous Distributions}
For programs that can sample from continuous probability distributions, the formalism needs to be extended.
Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote a set of addresses.
For each address $a \in \mathcal{A}$ we assign a reference measure space $(V_a, \Sigma_a, \mu_a)$ where $\mu_a$ is $\sigma$-finite ($V$ stands for `values').
Let $T := \cup_{A \subseteq \mathcal{A} : |A| < \infty} \{(A, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in \times_{a \in S} X_a\}\}$ denote the set of all finite traces (i.e. dictionaries) from addresses in $\mathcal{A}$ to their values.
For each finite $A \subseteq \mathcal{A}$, let $\Sigma_A := \otimes_{a \in A} \Sigma_a$ (the product $\sigma$-algebra over $\Sigma_a$ for $a \in A$), and let $\mu_A := \times_{a \in A} \mu_a$ (the product measure).
Let $\Sigma \subseteq \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the $\sigma$-algebra formed by sets of the form $B := \cup_{A \subseteq \mathcal{A}, |A| < \infty} \{(A, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in B_A\}$ for some $B_A \in \Sigma_A$ for each $A$.
Let $\mu : \Sigma \to [0, \infty)$ be a measure on measurable space $(T, \Sigma)$ defined by $\mu(B) := \sum_{A \subseteq \mathcal{A}, |A| < \infty} \mu_A(B_A)$.

A probabilistic program $P$ denotes a probability density $p : T \to [0, \infty)$ with respect to a reference measure $\mu$ on traces.
Describing the denotational semantics of a particular probabilistic programming language (the function mapping programs $P$ to density functions $p$) is out of scope for this paper.
We refer to the reader to~\citet{popl} for an example of denotational semantics of a probabilistic programming language that uses explicit addresses for random-choices.

This formalism is capable of expressing probabilistic programs that use continuous distributions by setting the reference measure space $(V_a, \Sigma_a, \mu_a)$ for some addresses $a$ to use the Lebesgue-measure.
For example, consider the following probabilistic program:

TODO: Give an example of a probabilistic program in Gen's dynamic modeling language that includes continuous random choices, and show the reference measure on traces and its density.

% step 1: *assert* that the composition of p and then q defines a probabilistic program with ref meas mu and mut. abs. cont. pi(z) [ok] (( do this without ascribing separate semantics to p and q?? ))
% step 2: show detailed balance on the joint space ... [ok]
% step 3: show stationarity on the joint space [ok, easy from detailed balance]
% step 4: show stationarity with respect to space of p.... ((requires ascribing semantics to p, but maybe not q??)
% - this would be straightforward for a product space, but our space is more complicated?
% - need to assert relationship between p and pi, ... 

TODO: somewhere, talk about hierarchical addresses
%\paragraph{Hierarchical addresses}

\subsection{Involutive MCMC with probabilistic programs}

To define model the auxiliary densitites used in involutive MCMC in Section~\ref{sec:involutive-mcmc} using probabilistic programs, we write one probabilistic program ($P$) to define the model's probability distribution, and another probabilistic program ($Q$) to define the set of auxiliary distributions.
The model reference measure $(X, \Sigma_P, \mu_P)$ and density required in Section~\ref{sec:involutive-mcmc} are set to the probabilistic program's reference measure on traces as defined above and density $p$ (so that $X := T$).
To define the auxiliary densities, we require a probabilistic program $Q$ that is parametrized by (i.e. takes as input) traces of the model program $P$.
The set of possible inputs to $Q$ is $\{x \in T : p(x) > 0\}$, and for each such $x$ the probabilistic program $Q$ defines a density $q_x : T \to [0, \infty)$ with respect to the reference measure on traces.\footnote{
Note that we the same measure space $(T, \Sigma, \mu)$ on traces for both the model and auxiliary probabilistic program.
If both programs sample some random choice at the same address $a$ and require different measure spaces $(V_a, \Sigma_a, \mu_a)$ for the address, this can be handled formally by making the addresses sampled by the two programs disjoint by prepending either the prefix `p.' or `q.' to addresses.
This is only required for book-keeping in the formalism, and these prefixes do not need to be actually added to the addresses used in the programs.}

Full support requirement (that for all structures and assignments to discrete random variables within the support, the other addresses have complete support).
Also for a pair of programs.
Use it guarantee that $X := \{(t, u) : \pi(t, u) > 0\} \in \Sigma_P \otimes \Sigma_Q$?

\subsection{Derivation of the pushforward Radon-Nikodym derivative for a special case} \label{sec:radon-nikodym-special-case}
Implementing Algorithm~\ref{alg:involutive-mcmc} requires computing the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\mu \circ f^{-1}) / d \mu$.
This section derives that function for the special case in which the involution $f$ can be factored into an involution on a countable set $I$ and a family of bijections on $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ for some $n_i$ for each $i \in I$.
Suppose $Z = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : i \in I, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}\}$.
Suppose $f_1$ is an involution on $I$ and $n_i = n_{f_1(i)}$ and $f_2$ is a family of continuously differentiable bijections indexed by $i \in I$, such that $f_{2,i} : \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$.
Also suppose that $f_{2,i} = f_{2,f_1(i)}^{-1}$ for all $i \in I$. That is,
\begin{equation}
f_{2,i}(f_{2,f_1(i)}(\mathbf{x})) = \mathbf{x} \mbox{ for all } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \mbox{ and all } i \in I
\end{equation} 
Then, $f : Z \to Z : (i, \mathbf{x}) \mapsto (f_1(i), f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x}))$ is an involution because:
\begin{equation}
f(f(i, \mathbf{x})) = f(f_1(i), f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x})) = (f_1(f_1(i)), f_{2,f_1(i)}(f_{2,i}(\mathbf{x}))) = (i, \mathbf{x})
\end{equation}
Let $\Sigma_n$ and $\mu_n$ denote the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra and Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively.
Let $\Sigma \subset \mathcal{P}(Z)$ be the $\sigma$-algebra of sets of the form $\cup_{i \in I} \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i\}$ for some $A_i \in \Sigma_{n_i}$ for each $i \in I$.
%Let $\Sigma$ be the $\sigma$-algebra on $Z$ generated by the sets $G := \{ \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} : i \in I, A \in \Sigma_{n_i} \}$.
%Note that the sets $G$ form a $\pi$-system:
%\begin{align}
%\{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} \cap \{(j, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in B\} = \varnothing = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in \varnothing \} \in G \mbox{ for } i \ne j\\
%\{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A\} \cap \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in B\} = \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A \cap B\} \in G \mbox{ because } A \cap B \in \Sigma_{n_i}
%\end{align}
Let $\mu$ denote the measure on measurable space $(Z, \Sigma)$ given by:%, uniquely defined by its value on the sets $G$:
\begin{equation}
\mu(\cup_{i \in I} \{(i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i\}) := \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(A_i)
\end{equation}
We wish to show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the pushforward of $\mu$ by $f$ with respect to $\mu$, evaluated at $(i, \mathbf{x})$, is the absolute value of the Jacobian (determinant) of the function $f_{2,i}$ evaluated at $\mathbf{x}$, which is denoted $(J f_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(i, \mathbf{x})
= \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right|
\end{equation}
Consider $(\mu \circ f^{-1})(A)$ for $A \in \Sigma$:
\begin{align}
(\mu \circ f^{-1})(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \})
&= \mu(f^{-1}(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \}))\\
&= \mu(\cup_{i \in I} f^{-1}(\{ (i, \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in A_i \}))\\
&= \mu(\cup_{i \in I} \{ (f_1(i), \mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in f_{2,i}(A_i) \})\\
&= \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i))
\end{align}
It suffices to show that for all $A \in \Sigma$:
\begin{equation}
\int_A \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu(dz) = \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i))
\end{equation}
Expanding the left-hand side:
\begin{align}
\int_A \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu(dz)
= \sum_{i \in I} \int_{A_i} \left| (Jf_{2,i})(\mathbf{x})\right| \mu_{n_i}(d \mathbf{x}) % TODO how to justify this? it seems obvious
= \sum_{i \in I} \mu_{n_i}(f_{2,i}(A_i)) % Borgachev Theorem 4.7.1 
\end{align}
where the final step uses Borgachev Theorem 3.7.1 with $g := 1$, and $F := f_{2,i}$.

\subsection{Proof of detailed balance for involution} \label{sec:involution-detailed-balance}

%(note that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite since $\mu_P \times \mu_Q$ is $\sigma$-finite. % TODO: prove this 
%Suppose that $\pi$ is a probability density with respect to $\mu$. % TODO is this guaranteed?
\end{proof}


\citet{tierney1998note} gives a class of MCMC kernels based on involutions that satisfy detailed balance.
We reproduce the result in our notation:
\begin{lemma}[Detailed balance for involution move~\citep{tierney1998note}] \label{lemma:tierney-involution}
Let $(Z, \Sigma, \pi)$ denote a measure space.
Suppose $f$ is a one-to-one function from $Z$ onto $Z$ such that $f^{-1} = f$.
Consider the probability kernel $k$ defined by $k_z(A) := [f(z) \in A] \alpha(z, f(z)) + [z \in A] (1 - \alpha(z, f(z)))$ (where $\alpha(z, f(z))$ gives the probability of accepting a proposed transition from $z$ to $f(z)$).
Let $\nu(dz) := \pi(dz) + (\pi \circ f^{-1})(dz)$.
Let $h(z)$ be a density for $\pi$ with respect to $\nu$.
Let $A := \{z \in Z : h(z) > 0 \mbox{ and } h(f(z)) > 0\}$.
$k$ satisfies detailed balance with respect to $\pi$ if and only if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\alpha(z, f(z)) = 0$ for $\pi$-almost all $z \not \in A$
\item $\alpha(z, f(z)) \frac{h(z)}{h(f(z))} = \alpha(f(z), z)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

Now we apply Lemma~\ref{lemma:tierney-involution} to our setting where $\pi$ is $\sigma$-finite, there exists a $\sigma$-finite reference measure $\mu$ for measurable space $(Z, \Sigma)$ such that $\pi$ is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, and where the pushforward of $\mu$ by $f$, denoted $\mu \circ f^{-1}$, is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$.
%(One step in the proof---Equation~\ref{eq:mu-is-absolutely-continuous-with-respect-to-nu}---will also require that $\mu$ is also absolutely continuous with respect to $\pi$, which is possible if we restrict $Z$ to the support of $\pi$, $\{z : (d \pi / d \mu)(z) > 0\}$, which must be in the $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$).

In our setting, $\alpha$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(z, f(z)) := \mbox{min}\left\{1, \frac{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(f(z))}{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z)} \cdot \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z)\right\}
\end{equation}
This definition of $\alpha$ satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(z, f(z)) \frac{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z)}{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(f(z))} \cdot \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu} (z)\right)^{-1}= \alpha(f(z), z)
%\frac{\alpha(z, f(z))}{\alpha(f(z), z)} = \frac{\pi(T(z))}{\pi(z)} \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ T^{-1})}{d \mu} (z) \right)
\end{equation}
Therefore, to apply Lemma~\ref{lemma:tierney-involution}, it suffices to show $\pi$ has density with respect to $\nu$ (denoted $h(z)$) such that:
\begin{equation}
\frac{h(z)}{h(f(z))} = \frac{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z)}{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(f(z))} \left( \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu} (z)\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
Since $\pi$ and $\pi \circ f^{-1}$ are both absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, $\nu$ is also absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, and has density:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z) = \frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z) + \frac{d (\pi \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z) 
\end{equation}
$\pi$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\nu$, and therefore:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z) = \frac{d \pi}{d \nu}(z) \cdot \frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)
\end{equation}
Because $(d \pi / d \mu)(z) > 0$ for all $z \in Z$, $(d \nu / d \mu)(z) > 0$ for all $z \in Z$.
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
h(z)
:= \frac{d \pi}{d \nu}(z)
= \frac{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z)}{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)}
\end{equation}
Therefore:
\begin{equation}
\frac{h(z)}{h(f(z))} = \frac{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(z)}{\frac{d \pi}{d \mu}(f(z))} \cdot \frac{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z))}{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)}
\end{equation}
It suffices to show that:
\[
\frac{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z))}{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)} = \left(\frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z)\right)^{-1}
\]

First, we prove a Lemma:
\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:reference-measure-pushforward}
If $(Z, \Sigma)$ is a measurable space and $f : Z \to Z$ is a measurable function that is an involution, $\nu$ and $\mu$ are $\sigma$-finite measures such that $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, and such that the pushforward measures $\nu \circ f^{-1}$ and $\mu \circ f^{-1}$ are both $\sigma$-finite, then
$\nu \circ f^{-1}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu \circ f^{-1}$ and
\begin{equation}
\frac{d (\nu \circ f^{-1})}{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}(z) = \frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z))
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First, $\nu \circ f^{-1}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu \circ f^{-1}$ because
$(\mu \circ f^{-1})(A) = 0$ implies $\mu(f^{-1}(A)) = 0$ implies $\nu(f^{-1}(A)) = 0$ implies $(\nu \circ f^{-1})(A) = 0$.
To show that $z \mapsto (d \nu / d \mu)(f(z))$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\nu \circ f^{-1}) / d (\mu \circ f^{-1})$, it suffices to show that for all $A \in \Sigma$:
\begin{equation}
\int_A \left( \frac{d \nu}{d \mu} (f(z)) \right) ( \mu \circ f^{-1} )(dz) = (\nu \circ f^{-1})(A) := \nu(f^{-1}(A))
\end{equation}
Applying Theorem 3.6.1 in Bogachev with $Y := A$, $y := z$, $x := z'$, $X := f^{-1}(A)$, and $g(y) := (d\nu / d\mu)(f(y))$:
\begin{align}
\int_A \left( \frac{d \nu}{d \mu} (f(z)) \right) ( \mu \circ f^{-1} )(dz)
&= \int_Y g(y) ( \mu \circ f^{-1} )(dy)\\
&= \int_X g(f(x)) \mu(dx) \;\;\;\; [\mbox{Bogachev Theorem 3.6.1}]\\
&= \int_{f^{-1}(A)} (d\nu / d\mu)(f(f(z'))) \mu(dz')\\
&= \int_{f^{-1}(A)} (d\nu / d\mu)(z') \mu(dz')\\
&= \int_{f^{-1}(A)} \nu(dz')
= \nu(f^{-1}(A))
\end{align}
% NOTE Bogachev's theorem uses domains of integration which are the whole
% sample spaces for the two sigma algebras.  I think that the theorem should
% also apply to any measurable sets A and T(A) because one can construct a
% sigma algebra and measure that are restricted to to any nonempty measurable
% set.

\end{proof}

Now, note that $\nu$ and $\nu \circ f^{-1}$ are the same measure:
\begin{align}
\nu(A) &= \pi(A) + \pi'(A) = \pi(A) + \pi(f^{-1}(A))\\
(\nu \circ f^{-1})(A) &= \pi(f^{-1}(A)) + \pi(f^{-1}(f^{-1}(A))) = \pi(f^{-1}(A)) + \pi(A)
\end{align}
Therefore,
\[
\frac{d (\nu \circ f^{-1})}{d \nu}(z) = 1 \mbox{ for all } z
\]
Expanding $d(\nu \circ f^{-1}) / d \nu$ using the chain rule:
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{d (\nu \circ f^{-1})}{d \nu}(z)\\
&=   \frac{d (\nu \circ f^{-1})}{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}(z) \cdot
    \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z) \cdot
    \frac{d \mu}{d \nu}(z) \label{eq:mu-is-absolutely-continuous-with-respect-to-nu}\\
&= \frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z)) \cdot \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z) \cdot \frac{d \mu}{d \mu}(z) \;\;\;\; [\mbox{Lemma~\ref{lemma:reference-measure-pushforward}}]\\
&= \frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z)) \cdot \frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z) \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)}\\
\left(\frac{d (\mu \circ f^{-1})}{d \mu}(z)\right)^{-1} &= \frac{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(f(z))}{\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}(z)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Proof of stationarity for involution} \label{sec:involution-is-stationary}
Detailed balance of the the involution kernel with respect to the measure induced by $\pi$ implies:
\begin{equation}
\int_B \pi(z) k'_z(A) \mu(dz) = \int_A \pi(z) k'_z(B) \mu(dz) \;\; \mbox{ for all } A, B \in \Sigma
\end{equation}
Stationarity with respect to $\pi$ follows by substituting $Z$ for $B$:
\begin{align}
\int_Z \pi(z) k'_z(A) \mu(dz) &= \int_A \pi(z) k'_z(Z) \mu(dz) = \int_A \pi(z) \mu(dz) \;\; \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma\\
\end{align}

\subsection{Proof of stationarity for end-to-end kernel} \label{sec:involutive-mcmc-is-stationary}
We are given that the involution is stationary with respect to (the measure induced by) $\pi(x, u) := p(x) q_x(u)$:
\begin{equation}
\int_Z k'_z(A) \pi(z) \mu(dz) = \int_A \pi(z) \mu(dz) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma
\end{equation}
The end-to-end kernel is defined fir all $x \in X_P$ such that $p(x) > 0$ as:
\begin{equation}
k_x(A) := \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_U(du) \;\; \mbox{for all} \;\; A \in \Sigma_P, x \in X
\end{equation}
Stationarity of the end-to-end kernel with respect to the measure induced by $p$ is:
\begin{equation}
\int_X k_x(A) p(x) \mu_P(dx) = \int_A p(x) \mu_P(dx) \mbox{ for all } A \in \Sigma_P
\end{equation}
Expanding:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X k_x(A) p(x) \mu_P(dx) &= \int_X \left( \int_U k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) \mu_Q(du) \right) p(x) \mu_P(dx)\\
    &= \int_{X \times U} k'_{x,u}(A \times U) q_x(u) p(x) (\mu_P \times \mu_Q)(dz) \;\; [\mbox{ Tonelli's theorem }]\\ % TODO check
    &= \int_{Z} k'_{x,u}(\{(x', u') \in Z : x' \in A\}) \pi(z) \mu(dz)\\ % TODO justify
    &= \int_{\{(x, u) \in Z : x \in A\}} \pi(z) \mu(dz)\;\;\; [\mbox{ Stationarity of $k'$ with respect to $\pi$}]\\
    &= \int_{\{(x, u) \in Z : x \in A\}} q_x(u) p(x) \mu(dz)\\
    &= \int_A \left( \int_U q_x(u) \mu_Q(du) \right) p(x) \mu_P(dx)\\
    &= \int_A p(x) \mu_P(dx)
\end{align*}
% TODO characterize the various assumptions that allow us to e.g. rearrange the order of integration, etc.

%\paragraph{Proof of stationarity}
%We need the composition of the two programs to define a valid probabilistic program with density $\pi$ that is absolutely continuous with respect to the refernce measure $\mu$.
%We also need there to be a particular relationship between $\pi$ and $p$.
%The involution part of the kernel is a kernel on the combined space $(Z, \Sigma_Z, \mu)$.
%\[
%k'_z(B_Z) = [f(z) \in B_Z] \alpha(z) + [z \in B_Z] (1 - \alpha(z))
%\]
%The kernel of Algorithm 1 is defined by:
%\[
%k_t(B_T) := \int_{U_t} q_{t}(u) k'_{(t, u)}(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) \mu_{Q,t}(du)
%\]
%We want to show it is stationary:
%\begin{align}
%\int_T k_t(B_T) p(t) \mu_P(dt) &= p(B_T) \mbox{ for all } B_T \in \Sigma_P\\
%\int_T \left( \int_{U_t} q_{t}(u) k'_{(t, u)}(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) \mu_{Q,t}(du) \right) p(t) \mu_P(dt) &= p(B_T)\\
%\sum_{i} \int_{T_C} \left( \int_{U_t} q_{t}(u) k'_{(t, u)}(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) \mu_{Q,t}(du) \right) p(i, t_c) \mu_{P_C,i}(dt_c) &= p(B_T)\\ % separate out discrete part of t (i) and continuous part of t (t_c)
%\sum_{i} \int_{T_C} \left( \int_{U_i} q_{t}(u) k'_{(t, u)}(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) \mu_{Q,i}(du) \right) p(i, t_c) \mu_{P_C,i}(dt_c) &= p(B_T)\\ % use that the reference measure mu_{Q,t} only depends on the discrete part
%..\\
%\int_{Z} \pi(t, u) k'_{t,u}(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) \mu(dz) &= p(B_T)\\
%\pi(\{(t', u') \in Z : t' \in B_T\}) &= p(B_T)\\
